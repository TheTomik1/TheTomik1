### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

â–º Currently I am using Python the most as I really love how powerful it's.<br>
â–º I have a lot of experience with databases and using MySQL with Python in a general.<br>
â–º I am Planning on learning Java as soon as my Python projects are finsished and I will have more time.<br>
â–º In a meantime I would like to continue learning Git commands and how it works in a general, and maybe try learning Docker too.<br>
